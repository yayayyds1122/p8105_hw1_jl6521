## Problem 1: dataset description

The penguins dataset contains the 3 species of penguins(“species”), name
of island (“island”) such as Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen, and their
various features, such as their length and depth of bill
(“bill_length_mm”)(“bill_depth_mm”), their flipper length
(“flipper_length_mm”), their body mass (“body_mass_g”), their sex
(“sex”), and their age (“year”). All the detailed information are listed
below in the summary table. The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns, and
the mean flipper length is 200.9152.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
summary(penguins)
```

## Problem 2

The data frame is created:

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(10),
  log_vec = c(x>0),
  char_vec = c("Who","is","the","smartest","person","in","the","world","Ya","Ya"),
  fac_vec = factor(c("good","very good","super good","good","very good","super good","good","very good","super good","super good"))
)
problem2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##          x log_vec char_vec fac_vec   
    ##      <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1 -1.56   FALSE   Who      good      
    ##  2  1.30   TRUE    is       very good 
    ##  3  0.572  TRUE    the      super good
    ##  4  0.995  TRUE    smartest good      
    ##  5  3.11   TRUE    person   very good 
    ##  6 -0.498  FALSE   in       super good
    ##  7  0.0194 TRUE    the      good      
    ##  8 -0.534  FALSE   world    very good 
    ##  9 -0.588  FALSE   Ya       super good
    ## 10  0.855  TRUE    Ya       super good

Next, we found that the numeric random sample and logical vector can
take a mean; character vector and factor vector can’t take a mean.

``` r
x = pull(problem2_df, var = x)
mean(x)
```

    ## [1] 0.3679904

``` r
log_vec = pull(problem2_df, var = log_vec)
mean(log_vec)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
char_vec = pull(problem2_df, var = char_vec)
mean(char_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(char_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
fac_vec = pull(problem2_df, var = fac_vec)
mean(fac_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(fac_vec): argument is not numeric or logical: returning
    ## NA

    ## [1] NA

When we explicitly convert variables from one type to numeric vectors,
logical and factor variables are converted successfully to numeric
vectors while character variables can’t. Logical vectors can be
converted to either 0 or 1 since it’s only TRUE and FALSE. Factor
vectors can be converted to numerical but they are only at their levels.
Character variables can’t be converted at all.

I think this helps explain the result since the function mean is
converting variables to numeric, and logical vectors can be converted.
Factor vector can’t be converted because the numeric values are only
their levels, so calculating the mean is meaningless. Character
variables can’t be taken mean.

``` r
new_log = as.numeric(log_vec)
print(new_log)
```

    ##  [1] 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1

``` r
new_char = as.numeric(char_vec)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
new_fac = as.numeric(fac_vec)
print(new_fac)
```
